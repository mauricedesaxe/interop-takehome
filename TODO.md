# TODO (leftovers)

So at this point I haven't done everything that was required or that I wanted to do.
But I'm probably on time (haven't tracked, but just a gut feeling).

What's left to do, in no particular order:
- [ ] Add the Recent Transaction History page
- [ ] Test the app with slow internet connection to find potential issues
- [X] Implement Toast for notifications
- [ ] Small "polish" UX improvements like sending/linking the user to the bridge page after swap, etc
- [X] Make it pretty
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness, accessibility, etc

I think I've done a good job of showing how I structure my code, commits, thinking even without the Transaction History page.

I don't think I've done a good job of showing I can make something look nice.
So, I'll do that now even if it means going a bit over time.

But I'll keep git history linear so that it's easy to see where I left off when I was on time.

I hope that makes sense to you.

## After some prettifying

I've done some prettifying.
Nothing too crazy, I'm no designer.

But just a tad bit better.

Anyway, you could probably spend forever on this part.
I just meant to show something somewhat presentable.
